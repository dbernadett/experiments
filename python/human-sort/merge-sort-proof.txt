Proof that two elements are not compared twice
nx1 elements
 | each element is compared against its neighbor
(n/2)*n elements
 | each element has only been compared against others in its group
 | and will only be compared against elements in other groups
...
1*n elements

Sorting is inconsistent if for some n elements, 1 > 2 > .. > n-1 > n > 1
aka there is a chain of sorting comparisons, aka some "a" < "n" is compared to some "b" > "n" or visa-versa

nx1 elements
 | each element is compared with a new value
(n/2)*n elements
 | Each element is compared with a new value

since each element "a" is only compared against new values, and if "b" is greater than "a", it will never be compared against 
for each comparison "a" and "b", the greator will never be compared against the lessor's lessors.
